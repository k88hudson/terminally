Greetings, human. What shall I call you?
$
--> name

Well hello, {{name}}.
I am TERMINALLY. I was sent here to help you get around. Why not try typing ls?
$
--> resp_1

[if resp_1 is not ls]
Hm, that's not quite right. Try again?

[else]
door1   door2   door3

That's great work, {{name}}. ls shows you a list of all the things you can find in the current directory. In this case, there are three doors.
Time for a new command. If you type cd door1, you will enter into the directory door1. Try it now.
$
--> resp_2

[if resp_2 is not cd door1]
Wrong command, human. You must comply. Try again.

[else]
Great, you went into door1. Why not look around?
$
--> resp_3

[if resp_3 is not ls]
Hm, that was not quite right. Try again? Just type ls.

[else]
note.txt

See that thing there? It's a file. You might want to try reading it.
Of course, you could also continue to be hopelessly stuck in this program, forever.
I'd like that.
